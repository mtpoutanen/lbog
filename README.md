Little Bits of Good, UCL Summer Project 2013

# Project Summary

The idea of the project was to explore the concept of creating an online platform with social media integration, where charitable organisations could find volunteer software developers for their IT projects. The main goal was to learn about creating web applications and learn python, django and front end frameworks, all of which were mostly unknown to me before the project. In hindsight many things could've been done differently, but overall the project was well received by my supervisor and was awarded a distinction in the end.
